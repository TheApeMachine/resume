## SellaBand : CTO

AMSTERDAM: APR 2009 - APR 2010

As a pioneer of crowd-funding SellaBand allowed any person to "invest" into
an artist or band and be part of bringing them to a threshold level of 50.000
Dollars, after which they would take this money and spend it on recording and
promoting an album to which the people who had invested own a certain share.

### Remarks

Early on there was a requirement to change the "old" code base and implement a
new design that came from an agency.
This was done relatively quickly, yet complicated by the code being partly in Ruby
but not Rails, as an external source had tried to make their own framework like Rails.
The rest was written in Php by the then current CTO who left early on for unknown
reasons, after which I inherited that job.

I gave the advice to rewrite the entire platform, as it was not maintainable this way.
Not only the non standard Ruby implementation, which was not great, but the Php on the side
gave me enough reason to give this advice, which is usually not what I prefer.
I was given two months to complete, and we made this deadline.

I hired a couple new people and we all worked quite hard, but got it all in right on time.

There were very interesting and sometimes complicated challenges here. Managing the work and
people while also developing full-time was ok, since everybody was quickly self-sufficient in
their jobs.
The technical issue of having to divide return of investments over many people who bought
shares in an album was probably the most complicated feature that took the most time.
