### Stack

| Ruby (on Rails)     | Scrum               | Jenkins                |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Main Monolith       | Introduce Scrum     | Continuous Integration |
| Payment Providers   | Host Retrospectives | Continuous Deployments |
| A/B Testing Pricing | Host Sprint Reviews | Maintenance            |

### Remarks

The stack was relatively simple and standard in the Ruby on Rails world.
Interesting things I worked on was the integration of new payment providers,
as well as a custom A/B testing framework that could run arbitrary buckets
of testable groupings, such that prices could be tested on a very granular
level of user segmentation.

In this company I also saw and worked with what I conside the best CI/CD
setup I have seen so far, which was all done in Jenkins, but that is not
entirely relevant.
It did make it so that basically any developer could comfortably push code,
even all the way to production if given no other choice.
