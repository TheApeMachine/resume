## Victor Chandler International : Full Stack Developer

GIBRALTAR: APR 2010 - OCT 2010

Online gaming provider/opertator.
Back in this time the backend was a combination of Ruby on Rails and Java Server Pages,
with a couple of external Rest and SOAP API endpoints located externally for things like
Player Management, payments, etc.

### Stack

| Ruby (on Rails)  | Javascript           | Release Cycles |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Backoffice       | Prototype            | Scrum Process  |
| Main PLayer Site | jQuery               | QA Department  |
| Multi Lingual    | Performance Tweaking | Deployment     |

### Remarks

My main tasks where an in-depth cleanup of the Prototype javascript,
moving towards jQuery, and looking at minimizing the amount of scripts
being imported and optimizing DOM traversal and lookups.

After that I worked on the multi-lingual system, both implementing
RTL languages as well as a backoffice tool to make the lives of translators
easier.
Besides that I wrote a Ruby script to alter the actual source files of the
player website code to replace all strings with a multi-lingual tag as per
the Ruby on Rails framework.

Finally we started a large project to rewrite the entire stack in monolithic
Ruby on Rails architecture.

In this company I learned how much comfort and safety a good QA team bring to the
table during the development cycle.
