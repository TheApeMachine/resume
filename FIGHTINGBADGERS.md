## Fighting Badgers Ltd. : CEO

LONDON: OCT 2013 - DEC 2014

After coming back from Los Angeles and seeing many "normal" people like me
work on their own movies with nothing but consumer gear I realized that this
was a real option and it reignited a dream I had when I was younger to make
a movie.
So I shot a feature film with a large group of people I found online.

### Remarks

The movie was shot over 21 days at 34 locations with 24 actors and 17 crew.

To be prepared for this challenge we prepared and planned the 21 day shoot
over the course of 4 months as we found access to locations and learned about
risk assessments and other forms to fill out, while auditioning and reading with
actors and interviewing additional crew.

This experience has taught me more than I could have predicted about team
dynamics and how to not just get people to do what you want, but translate
ideas to the point where people are fully aligned such that they will often
have the idea before you.

Even on the independent level the director is still seen as a benevolent
dictator, and since a vision is being executed every single decision has to
be made by you by default.
Even when you tell people to take liberties with that because I wanted to
be a different kind of director.
This experience has taught me how to deal with many requests for information
every day and at this point I usually respond quickly and always.

Working with actors is a special kind of challenge, but quite fun once you
learn the do's and don't's.
I approached directing mostly from a programmer's perspective at first, so
as a problem solver, which worked well in some situations, but less so when
approaching the acting process.
I learned to trust what they were telling me about their needs though as I
can only imagine how difficult it must be to realistically portray something
that is essentially rediculous in the real world.
To that note, we also had a lot of laughter precisely because of that reason.
There is no end to how funny actors can be when they mess up a scene.

Working with the crew was really good though. With them the programmer mindset
rhymed a lot better and I was lucky to find a Director of Photography who was
very much on the same page as me when it came to taste, and he prepared me a
lot beforehand on what would be needed and why, as the artistic motivations
where a new concept to me.
The crew was also selected very carefully, as I knew attempting a feature film
was a challenge.
