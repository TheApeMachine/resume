# Languages

In order of favoritism (leaving out the ones I can't remember at the moment):

- Go
  - The first I reach for if it needs to be anything more than a one-off script.
  - Love how it makes the design naturally concurrent and some of its opinionated (forced) standards.
  - Hate the trailing comma thing. Too far!
- Ruby
  - Love the clean syntax.
  - Love the easy meta-programming features.
  - Eventually too slow and not strongly typed enough to be a one-stop shop for any requirement.
- Erlang
  - Having no loops is great. Takes your designs to next levels.
  - Enjoy the syntax.
  - Hate the recursion termination. Not a fan of method (or constructor) overloading.
- Python
  - Reasonable syntax, just compared to Ruby not ideal.
  - Good for machine learning prototypes.
  - One benefit over Ruby is that it shows a few techniques in a way that was easier for me to understand.
- Fortran
  - I like it for its simple syntax but incredible speed working with matrices.
  - The first language I learned when I discovered I am effectively a language collector.
- Basic
  - My first language.
  - A very powerful learning tool to get into programming.
- Rust
  - I wish I liked it more.
  - For pure, raw performance, this would be my choice.
  - But again, I wish I liked it more to dive deeper into it, yet Go always wins by favoritism.
- Php
  - I learned it has more tricks up its sleeve that people give it credit for.
  - Recent improvements to the language have solved some of its canonical issues.
  - I came to mind it a lot less recently.
- Perl
  - Nothing good about it.
- Javascript
  - Not a great language, but still needed in the web developer world.
  - Typescript helped it a great deal though, to be completely fair.
- C
  - No longer needed after Rust, except to support legacy/existing projects.
- Delphi
  - My first official (professional) language.
- C++
  - No longer needed after rust, except to support legacy/existing projects.
- C#
  - Workable syntax.
  - Too verbose at times.
  - Eco-system is bloated and complex.
- PL/SQL
  - Useful extention to standard SQL syntax.
- Foxpro
  - Not much I can remember about it, but it was the first language I had to learn on-the-fly at a job.

I have also implemented some of my own basic languages, mostly based on stack or register virtual machine designs. These have never become very mature, and are just a hobby project.
