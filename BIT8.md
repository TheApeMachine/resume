## Bit8 : Team Lead (2nd Time)

MALTA: DEC 2020 - MAY 2021

Temporary contract to assist old colleagues go live to production with
three separate projects.
I acted as team lead, echoeing my previous experience with the company,
for a team of ten, a mixture of developers, QA, and BA.
Besides that I assisted in development tasks, providing various forms
of support to the team members, and hired and trained two new candidates
lifting it to its final number of ten.

### Stack

| .Net 4.7.1      | Php 5.40.6        | MySQL 8.0.24              |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Background jobs | Backend interface | Stored Procedures         |
| MySQL Interface | Refactoring       | Performance investigation |
| Tests           | Dockerizing       | SP to Execution Trees     |

### Remarks

Working with both very legacy code bases, while attempting modern
technique to the presented challenges was a well worth learning
experience from a technological perspective.

Pushing to release multiple projects to production within a tight
deadline was challenging, but also a victory as a team that was
not very used to each other yet quickly came together and made
it happen.

While eventually a much easier solution presented itself in the form
of _tmpfs_, the ByeSQL project was a particulary interesting coding
challenge for me, as I am not very experienced in .Net or C#.


## Bit8 : Team Lead (1st Time)

Bit8 provides a complete backend service solution for the gaming industry
where online gaming operators can consume services such as player management,

### Remarks

My first time as Team Lead in Bit8 I was mostly involved with the development
of a new player selection system, which was within the domain of my team.
Next to that I was involved with a full "platform evolution" project which was
at the time in the design and prototyping stage and focused around turning
parts of the platform into micro-services.
This project was never completed due to integration hell within the existing
code base and eventual time constraints.
Finally I took part in an effort from technology management on Continuous Improvement
meetings, where one of my assigned actions was to write a new code obfuscator for
Php, html, and javascript focussed around the Yii framework.

Meanwhile at the team level I introduced the team and implemented various Scrum processes,
such as stand-ups, grooming sessions, retrospectives, etc.
I was also heavily involved in mentoring more junior team members, and eventually two
summer internships, both people I would later meet again at Bit8 as full-time develoeprs during my second time there.
