## Gigit : CTO

LOS ANGELES: APR 2013 - OCT 2013

A platform that brings your favorite artists from your childhood to now
into your back garden.

End to end booking and services as a simple consumer website where you can
not only book the artist for a party in your back garden, office, rooftop, or
wherever, you can also include rental of sound equipment, lights, and even
engineers to operate it, depending on the size and scope of the event.

### Remarks

I was quite randomly contacted by the founder of Gigit and she and I quickly came
to the conclusion to continue building the Gigit platform into shape for initial
release.
Until that time development was out sourced and while the work turned out to be
decent, the price tag was no longer making sense with the time frame.
I continued development for a short period to be able to launch a viable product
and we got our first artists signed up.

Besides the relatively easy job in this case to build, host, and develop additional
features for the platform, we also had to be present at every single event to take
care of operations, as it was mainly just the two of us and later another person
taking care of communication and marketing.

It survived for a few months and many events were held mainly in Los Angeles, Las Vegas,
and New York.
At times this was relatively surreal and not a very typical office, or even startup, job.
