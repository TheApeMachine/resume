## Create50 : Full Stack Developer

LONDON: DEC 2014 - OCT 2016

Also a personal favorite of my experiences.

Create50 is a project coming out of Living Spirit Pictures, a small company
in London that is a key pillar in the independent film industry.
They are also the organizers of the London Screenwriters Festival.

The project broke records as bringing together the most writers and filmmakers
ever on a movie and to make this happen we built the Create50 platform, which
is part social media site, part collaboration tool and part judging and management
system.

### Stack

### Remarks

I found Create50 when coming back from Los Angeles and just shooting my own
movie in London.
I was looking at at least a few months of post-production and Create50 seemed
to be a perfect fit to do some work in the meantime.

There was definitely a challenge for time in this project, as the idea kept
growing bigger, but I was fully on board.
The platform that we built, by which I mean the C.E.O. mostly designed the
functionality and look and I implemented, was very specialized and customized
to the challenge of having many writers work on the same project with feedback
mechanisms, judging rounds, and eventual collaboration with filmmakers.
