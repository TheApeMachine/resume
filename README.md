## Before Considering My Application

I work 100% remote only, and am not able to come to an office under any circumstance. Given a recent experience, I would prefer not to be considered if this is in any way an issue or point of doubt. Personally I have experienced only benefits in concentration and amount of hours per day in working capacity (easily doubled), however this is not my "reason". I keep myself highly available at all times during working hours and will respond in most cases directly to a contact over chat, video or audio call, or any other communication tooling (I do sometimes walk the dog).

# Active Projects

## My Resume

[Project Link](https://github.com/theapemachine/resume)

**Techologies:** This resume (you are reading) is built with a Docker container when updates are pushed to a Git repository. It uses PanDoc to convert the Markdown files to PDF.

## Wrkspc

[Project Link](https://github.com/theapemachine/wrkspc)

**Technologies:** It dynamically downloads (Docker) container images that wrap the terminal command you try to use. It requires only one binary, which has both the Docker and Kubernetes source code linked as a package, can deploy clusters (both local and remote), or connect to existing clusters, to run the containers, or just use ContainerD locally (also built in).

## SPDG

- [Interface](https://github.com/theapemachine/spdg) Secure Private Data Grams (older version)
- [Implementation](https://github.com/TheApeMachine/binlog) example using MySQL binlog as an event source (older version).

**Technologies:** An experimental type written in Go (though concept could exist in any language) that acts as a wrapper around any other data type. Encodable via Gob encoders, more efficient (over WebSockets) than gRPC and much more flexible, recently had some real-world validation as used in the Rocsys system.

## Languages

In order of favoritism (leaving out the ones I can't remember at the moment):

- Go
- Ruby
- Erlang
- Python
- Fortran
- Basic
- Rust
- Php
- Perl
- Javascript
- C
- Delphi
- React
- Vue
- Web Components
- C++
- C#
- PL/SQL
- Foxpro

I have also implemented some of my own basic languages, mostly based on stack or register virtual machine designs. These have never become very mature, and are just a hobby project.
