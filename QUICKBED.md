## QuickBed : CTO

PARIS: OCT 2016 - MAR 2018

Applying technology to structured problems surrounding the European refugee crisis.
This project focused on the long-term housing of people by identifying lower star
hotels that would be able to convert to a long-term residence and provide a simple
booking solution to manage operations.

### Remarks

As a platform designing and developing QuickBed was a challenge in that as per
usual in a grassroots startup situation you need to get to viable products quite
fast, while still maintaining standards and quality.
We managed quite well, since at that time I had significant experience in these
situations to understand domains quickly and translate that to functional requirements.
The C.E.O. also had a background in Ruby on Rails so helped by being able to communicate
on a technical level.

From a code base perspective this was a pretty clean job, as there was not a huge amount
to build and was able to fit within the Rails conventions quite well, so rapid development
was easy and familiar allowing me to avoid the long routes and write optimizations just-in-time.

One interesting addition to the normal day to day was a constant involvement with related
side-projects in the form of hackathons and collaborations between companies.
I also became a mentor on the hackathons later on, where I would be one of many to offer
advice or a perspective on an ongoing project that the candidates can chose to do with
as they seem fit.

One of the more interesting projects was one I kind of designed on the fly for an event
called Data for Good.
The core idea was to improve database full text searches for informational systems to
be aware of the many ways and many languages people could be searching in.
The refugee sector relies a lot on various informational systems and streams and there
are specific challenges in the practical use of them.
The search method we developed incorporates what I call "keyword expansion" and a
scoring algorithm designed by the data scientists who decided to join our idea for the
coming few months.

The final presentation we gave can be found here: [link], it's not great quality and I am
far beyond nervous, but to this day happy that we managed to get it to work.
