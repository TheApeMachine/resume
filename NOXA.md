### Remarks

I started with converting the student accommodation platform from .Net to Ruby on Rails, basically a full rewrite,
while at the same time working on a large Ruby script to serve as a migration tool from SQL Server to Postgres.
As those projects completed and more people joined the fast growing company we worked on many monolithic frontends that
shared a connection to the same database as the overall management backoffice that could control every aspect of all the
frontends from a centralized location while being fully controlled by a custom role system to make it functionally
practical for a company that has many departments over many cities.

Learning Scrum was good preparation for where the industry was going as a whole, as it came back as a concept in many
following companies, and my early on experience has often made me the person to implement it in new companies.
I also believe this early exposure has the benefit of remembering what the original agile ideas were as the concept
has been slightly "tweaked" in a lot of companies I have seen.
