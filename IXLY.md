### Remarks

This company provided me with the interesting opportunity to work
on a mostly realized and much more advanced version of an idea I
once had that was similar.
My main responsabilities were writing a new end to end testing
framework for various psychological tests applied to human resourcing.

First time I had to dynamically generate PDF reports based on the data
collected, which was a useful skill to have later on.

Worked a lot with the in-house AI department to integrate their
mathematical solutions in the code, which was an active translation
process as I did not understand their math and they did not understand
my code, so it was a real one on one collaboration to get the code to work.
